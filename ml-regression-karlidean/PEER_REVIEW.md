## Section 1 - Organization and Clarity
This project was organized with the proper layout given in the instructions. It looks very neat.

## Section 2 - Feature Selection and Justification
I like that this person labeled each of the variables available post-cleaning their data. It makes understanding their features easier.\
\
They chose everything for their features, which I can understand, but some features did not correlate as well, and this could lead to overfitting the model to data that doesn't work as well.

## Section 3 - Model Performance and Comparisons
I wish I could've seen a metric at the end of all of the models compared against each other to define growth or increase of importance and significance. However, I find their model comparisons to be greater than satisfactory.

## Section 4 - Reflection Quality
This person's reflections were insightful and easy to understand. When running models of this caliber, this understanding and ease of translation is important!
